My name is Kenneth Pieterson. I'm a Business Analyst and Data Scientist. I'm originally from Ghana, Cape Coast, but I moved to Tennessee in 2022 to persue my masters in Business Administration with a concentration in Business Analytics.
I love all foods, particularly Asian food, but strangely I'm repelled by almost all forms of cheese. I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste! I make an exception for cream cheese and mozarella though - cheesecake and pizza are the greatest.
I am a fast learner, and work pretty well in teams.

Outside of work, I am a family oriented individual, love to read books and listen to Tech podcasts like The Waveform Podcast from MKBHD studios.

My GPA from UCC is 3.60
GPA from ETSU is 3.83.
